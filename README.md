<h1> FairPolitics project </h1><br>
Many times we see an imbalance between the issues that the elected official
focuses on and the issues that the electorate wanted to focus on. This case carries
with it a problem of not fulfilling the will of the voters, so we decided to fix
this by developing a system called <strong>Fair Politics</strong> that will help the elected official
who wants to get feedback from his voters to know which issues to focus, to divide
his time more correctly. Also, our system builds in a way such that we achieve the
highest satisfaction for most of the voters. We intend to build the feedback and
implement Dynamic Proportional Rankings algorithm feedback, such that the results
they get reflect the will of the voters. This system will be convenient and friendly
to the users, including support for a variety of languages common to the population.
Moreover, we have a unique identification to avoid bias in the results.
