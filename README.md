<h1> FairPolitics project </h1><br>
 Many times we see an imbalance between the issues that the elected
 offical focuses on and the issues that the electorate wanted to focus
 on. This case carries with it a problem of not fulfilling the will of
 the voters so we decided to fix this by developing a system called
 <strong> Fair Politics</strong> that will help the elected offical who wants to get
 feedback from his voter to know which issues to focus on in order to
 divide his time more correctly. We intend to build the feedback and
 implement Dynamic Proportional Rankings algorithm feedback so that the
 results they get reflects the will of the voters. This system will be
 conveniently and friendly to the electorate and elected by unique
 identification, Including support for a variety of languages common to
 the population.
